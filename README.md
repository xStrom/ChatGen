# ChatGen

This is a simple little script I wrote to help a friend render some Twitch VOD chats.

## Requirements

### FFmpeg

You need to have FFmpeg installed and the binary location configured in the script. [Download FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).

### TwitchDownloader

You need to have TwitchDownloader CLI installed and the binary location configured in the script. [Download TwitchDownloader CLI](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader).

## Usage

```
ChatGen [commands]

    -id 123456
        The Twitch VOD id number, e.g. 123456.

    -start 01:02:34
        Start time, e.g. 1 hour 2 minutes and 34 seconds of the VOD.

    -end 02:03:55
        End time, e.g. 2 hours 3 minutes and 55 seconds of the VOD.
